   <h3>LOUIS VUTTON</h3> 
   <p>Louis Vuitton Malletier, commonly known as Louis Vuitton (/luːˈiː vɪˈtɒn/ ⓘ, French: [lwi vɥitɔ̃] ⓘ), is a French luxury fashion house and company founded in 1854 by Louis Vuitton.[1] The label's LV monogram appears on most of its products, ranging from luxury bags and leather goods to ready-to-wear, shoes,[4] perfumes, watches, jewellery, accessories, sunglasses and books. Louis Vuitton is one of the world's leading international fashion houses. It sells its products through standalone boutiques, lease departments in high-end departmental stores, and through the e-commerce section of its website.[5][6</p>
   <p>For six consecutive years (2006–2012), Louis Vuitton was named the world's most valuable luxury brand. Its 2012 valuation was US$25.9 billion.[7] In 2013, the valuation of the brand was US$28.4 billion with revenue of US$9.4 billion.[8] The company operates in 50 countries with more than 460 stores worldwide.[9]</p>
   <p>Louis Vuitton is a subsidiary of LVMH and has faced some episodes of criticism: continuous targeting due to its failures in ceasing forced labour,[10][11][12] alleged mistreatment of its models in 2017,[13] and a series of strong polemics in Barcelona, Catalonia (due to sponsoring the 2024 America's Cup) that involved an administratively opaque fashion show,[14][15][16] significant damages in the Park Güell's UNESCO World Heritage Site,[17] and multiple citizen protests against the company.[18</p>
