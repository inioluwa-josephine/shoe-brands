  <h3>crocs</h3>  
  <p>In the history of dressing, controversial fashion trends are nothing new. But no footwear has been met with such polarizing response as Crocs. For over 20 years, the clog with Swiss cheese-like holes has garnered legions of both devoted fans and enemies. (Some, like me, have been on both sides.) Those who despise Crocs deem them the ugliest shoe on the planet, while Team Crocs supporters tend to have multiple pairs and wear them proudly, Jibbitz and all. Like them or not, Crocs are an icon of modern fashion.</p>
  <p>They’re also money makers: In 2022 alone, Crocs, according to the brand, brought in a record-breaking revenue of $2.7 billion. But how exactly did these funny-looking shoes reach those monumental heights?</p>
  <p>With Crocs, one could argue that there is a clear line between monetary success and coolness; the two are not mutually exclusive. In the mid-2000s, when Crocs was making its first of hundreds of millions of dollars, there weren’t many fashion-conscious 20 or 30-year-olds (then-Millennial and Gen-Xers) wearing them. Aughts-era It girls like Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, or Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen were never papped in Crocs. To me and my kitten-heel-and open-toed-platforms-wearing friends, they were a punchline.</p>
