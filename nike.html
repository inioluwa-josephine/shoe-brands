    <h1>NIKE</h1>
    <p> Nike, Inc., stylized as NIKE, is an American athletic footwear and apparel corporation headquartered near Beaverton, Oregon, United States. </p>
    <p>In the 1990s, Nike received criticism for its use of sweatshops.[122][123] Beginning in 1990, many protests occurred in big cities such as Los Angeles,[124] Washington, DC and Boston in order to show public outcry for Nike's use of child labor and sweatshops. Nike has been criticized for contracting with factories (known as Nike sweatshops) in countries such as China, Vietnam, Indonesia and Mexico. Vietnam Labor Watch, an activist group, has documented that factories contracted by Nike have violated minimum wage and overtime laws in Vietnam as late as 1996, although Nike claims that this practice has been stopped.</p>
    <p>As of July 2011, Nike stated that two-thirds of its factories producing Converse products still do not meet the company's standards for worker treatment. A July 2011 Associated Press article stated that employees at the company's plants in Indonesia reported constant abuse from supervisors</p>
